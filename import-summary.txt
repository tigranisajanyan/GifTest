ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* android/
* android/org/
* android/org/jcodec/
* android/org/jcodec/api/
* android/org/jcodec/api/android/
* android/org/jcodec/api/android/FrameGrab.java
* android/org/jcodec/api/android/SequenceEncoder.java
* android/org/jcodec/api/android/SequenceMuxer.java
* android/org/jcodec/common/
* android/org/jcodec/common/AndroidUtil.java
* android/org/jcodec/scale/
* android/org/jcodec/scale/BitmapUtil.java
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

* AndroidManifest.xml => jcodec/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* res/ => jcodec/src/main/res/
* src/ => jcodec/src/main/java/
* src/org/jcodec/testing/jm.conf => jcodec/src/main/resources/org/jcodec/testing/jm.conf

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
